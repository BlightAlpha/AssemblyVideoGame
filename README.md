# AssemblyVideoGame
In this project, I create games by application of the MARS Bitmap and Keyboard. The game rule is horizontally and vertically scrolling fish using the keyboard to escape the jellyfish and the seaweed. The timer for the game is 31.2 seconds and the timer bar is decremented by the time until it ends. In case where the fish collison with the jellyfish or the seaweed, the score bar is decremented by one until there is no score left. In the imer tab, it is assigned with 13 pixels to decrement the 31.2 seconds. And in the score tap, it is assigned with 13 pixels to decrement the socrore. When the game is over, there is the display of the star indicating the score earned.
